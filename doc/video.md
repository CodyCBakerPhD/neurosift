# Visualizing videos

To visualize a video, simply browse to and click the video file through the web browser. You can then use the controls to play, pause, and seek through the video. You can also click on the slider to seek to a specific time. Right now, only .mp4 and .avi files are supported (but we can easily expand this to other formats - just let us know).
