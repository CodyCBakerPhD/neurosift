# Neurosift / Dendro Workshop

September, 2024

## Workshop Goals

- Learn how to use Neurosift and Dendro with hands-on examples
- Plan future projects / extensions

## Goals of Neurosift and Dendro

* Advance cloud visualization and analysis of NWB files on DANDI

## Setup for workshop

It is highly recommended that you bring your own laptop so you can follow along with the examples. You have a couple options

* Run things on your local machine
  - Works with Linux, Mac OS, maybe Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and maybe Windows
  - You should install apptainer if you want to run the Dendro processing
* Run things on Dandihub (recommended)
  - Go to [https://hub.dandiarchive.org](https://hub.dandiarchive.org)
  - **Important:** You'll need to sign up ahead of time because it might take a bit of time to get approved. Please include "Neurosift+Dendro workshop" in the DANDI sign up form.
  - It is recommended that you select the "Base" server option.
  - Apptainer is already installed, but you'll need to `pip install --upgrade neurosift dendro`

Let's get started!

## What is Neurosift?

* DANDI Archive exploration
* NWB file visualization (remote and local)
* Runs in browser - no installation required
* No server backend required (client-only - except for Dendro integration)
* Efficiently reads data lazily from remote or local HDF5 files
* Inspired by NWBWidgets
* In collaboration with CatalystNeuro

## DANDI Archive / Neurosift Integration

* Go to [DANDI](https://dandiarchive.org/)
* Click on PUBLIC DANDISETS
* Search for a Dandiset, for example [000552](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000552?search=000552&pos=1)
* Click on FILES and [the first subject](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000552/0.230630.2304/files?location=sub-e13-16f1&page=1)
* Choose a .nwb file and click [OPEN WITH -> Neurosift](https://neurosift.app/?p=/nwb&url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/47be899c-27a8-4864-a1e9-d7a3f92e522e/download/&dandisetId=000552&dandisetVersion=0.230630.2304)

## Neurosift URL

Let's examine the above Neurosift URL

```text
https://neurosift.app/?p=/nwb&url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/47be899c-27a8-4864-a1e9-d7a3f92e522e/download/&dandisetId=000552&dandisetVersion=0.230630.2304
```
The `url` query parameter points to the DANDI Archive API. You can point that to the URL of any remote NWB file (not just on DANDI).

## Opening local NWB files

You can also view local NWB files

```bash
# One-time install of neurosift
pip install --upgrade neurosift

# Open the local file (will open a browser window)
neurosift view-nwb /path/to/file.nwb
```

You can try this out by downloading one of [these relatively small NWB files](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000946/draft/files?location=sub-BH494&page=1).

## Neurosift as DANDI Browser

The DANDI REST API is open, so Neurosift can also function as an alternative DANDI Archive explorer.

## Structure of an NWB file

* NWB (.nwb) uses HDF5 as the underlying format.
* HDF5 files store data hierarchically in groups and datasets, with metadata at each node.

* NWB imposes further structure on HDF5 to create a hierarchy of "Neurodata Objects".
* Examples of Neurodata objects include ElectricalSeries, Units, BehavioralEvents, LFP, TimeIntervals, etc.

## Efficient streaming of NWB files

* NWB files can be very large > 100 GB, so it's important to be able to loazy-load individual objects without downloading the entire file.
* However, HDF5 was designed to be read locally, so it's not particularly cloud-friendly - inefficient loading of metadata
* Neurosift uses a WebAssembly/Web Worker trick to load remote files relatively efficiently via the browser.
* But what really speeds things up is the pre-indexing of all the public Dandisets using LINDI.

For more information, see the [LINDI project](https://github.com/neurodatawithoutborders/lindi).

For example [open this file](https://neurosift.app/?p=/nwb&url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/25b641ae-5a56-49c2-893c-7dd19d039912/download/&dandisetId=000552&dandisetVersion=0.230630.2304). There is a "Using LINDI" indicator on the left panel meaning that it found the pre-indexed .nwb.lindi.json file in the cloud and used that instead of the .nwb. The .json file efficiently stores all the meta information and references the original file for the data chunks.

Here's an example LINDI JSON file for inspection: https://lindi.neurosift.org/dandi/dandisets/000552/assets/47be899c-27a8-4864-a1e9-d7a3f92e522e/nwb.lindi.json

## Streaming objects from NWB files using Python

You can load NWB objects using Python.

* Go to [our example NWB file](https://neurosift.app/?p=/nwb&url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/25b641ae-5a56-49c2-893c-7dd19d039912/download/&dandisetId=000552&dandisetVersion=0.230630.2304).
* Click on processing/behavior -> SleepStates
* Click on "Load in Python". You will get a Python script you can run to lazy load the data using LINDI.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f8670f3-280f-4755-a494-d3762b95d400)

```python
import lindi

url = 'https://lindi.neurosift.org/dandi/dandisets/000552/assets/25b641ae-5a56-49c2-893c-7dd19d039912/nwb.lindi.json'

# Load the remote file
f = lindi.LindiH5pyFile.from_lindi_file(url)

# load the neurodata object
X = f['/processing/behavior/SleepStates']

id = X['id']
label = X['label']
start_time = X['start_time']
stop_time = X['stop_time']

print(f'Shape of id: {id.shape}')
print(f'Shape of start_time: {start_time.shape}')
print(f'Shape of stop_time: {stop_time.shape}')

print(label[()])

# Output:
# Shape of id: (46,)
# Shape of start_time: (46,)
# Shape of stop_time: (46,)
# ['Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'REM' 'Awake'
#  'Non-REM' 'REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM'
#  'REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake'
#  'Non-REM' 'REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM'
#  'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'REM' 'Awake'
#  'Non-REM' 'REM' 'Awake' 'Non-REM' 'Awake']
```

# Neurosift tabs

What are the different Neurosift tabs?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c82e9c1-2816-4df9-8eda-7fc1ee21c01f)

## NWB Tab

The NWB tab gives a hierarchical layout of the Neurodata objects in the NWB file with links to various visualization plugins.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cf75967-d131-4bbd-8354-79508b13e833)

What are the checkboxes for?

* Clicking a Neurodata object directly will open the default visualization plugin for that Neurodata type.
* To get a synchronized composite view, tick more than one checkbox and then click the "View xx items" button on the left panel.

## RAW Tab

The RAW tab shows the raw HDF5 structure: groups, datasets, attributes, etc.

Hint: to inspect the contents of a larger dataset, open the browser developer console and click on the CIRCLE icon. The contents of the dataset will be printed to the console.
